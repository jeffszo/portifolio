          I develop responsive, visually pleasing and high-performance
          websites. Since 2013, I've enjoyed creating websites, even though I
          wasn't programming, I had already started my first websites on the Wix
          platform. And after a while, I was able to reacquaint myself with
          programming and front-end development. Furthermore, I am studying
          Systems Analysis and Development in the third semester.
